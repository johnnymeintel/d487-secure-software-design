## 📚 Key Frameworks & Models

### 🏗️ BSIMM (Building Security In Maturity Model)

**Purpose**: Studies real-world software security initiatives for benchmarking

**Four Domains**:

- 🏛️ **Governance**: Strategy, compliance, training programs
- 🧠 **Intelligence**: Attack models, security features, standards research
- 🔨 **SSDL Touchpoints**: Hands-on security activities (code review, testing)
- 🚀 **Deployment**: Configuration management, vulnerability management

**Key Distinction**: BSIMM is **descriptive** (what organizations actually do) vs SAMM is **prescriptive** (what you should do)

### ⚔️ STRIDE Threat Modeling

- **S**poofing: Identity impersonation attacks
- **T**ampering: Unauthorized data modification
- **R**epudiation: Denial of performed actions
- **I**nformation Disclosure: Unauthorized data access
- **D**enial of Service: Service availability attacks
- **E**levation of Privilege: Unauthorized access escalation

**Application Methods**:

- 🔍 **STRIDE-per-element**: Analyze each individual component/object
- ⚙️ **STRIDE-per-process**: Focus only on processes
- 🌉 **STRIDE-per-trust-boundary**: Analyze security boundary crossings
- 🔄 **STRIDE-per-interaction**: Focus on data flows between components

### 💥 DREAD Risk Scoring

**Ternary Scale**: High=3, Medium=2, Low=1

- **D**amage: Potential impact severity
- **R**eproducibility: How easily attack can be repeated
- **E**xploitability: Difficulty of executing the attack
- **A**ffected users: Scope and number of impacted users
- **D**iscoverability: How easy vulnerability is to find

**Total Score Interpretation**:

- 13-15 points = High Risk
- 8-12 points = Medium Risk
- 5-7 points = Low Risk

### 🔬 PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)

**Seven-Stage Methodology**:

1. **Define Objectives** - Business and security requirements
2. **Define Technical Scope** - Application boundaries and components
3. **Application Decomposition** - Break down architecture and data flows
4. **Threat Analysis** - Identify potential threats and attack vectors
5. **Vulnerability and Weakness Analysis** - **Design flaw analysis occurs here**
6. **Attack Modeling** - Develop specific attack scenarios
7. **Risk and Impact Analysis** - Evaluate business impact and likelihood

### 🏗️ Microsoft Threat Modeling

**Four-Step Process**:

1. **Diagram** - Create data flow diagrams
2. **Identify** - Find threats using STRIDE
3. **Mitigate** - Apply countermeasures
4. **Validate** - Verify threat mitigation effectiveness

## 🔐 Core Security Principles

### 🛡️ Access Control Principles

- 🔒 **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users get minimum necessary access
- 👥 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access based on user roles
- 🤝 **Separation of Duties**: Multiple people required for critical tasks
- 🏰 **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection

### 🛡️ Data Protection

- ✅ **Input Validation**: Verify user input meets expected criteria (type, size, range)
- 🔤 **Output Encoding**: Prevent XSS by encoding special characters (<, >, ", ', &)
- 💉 **Parameterized Queries**: Prevent SQL injection by separating code from data
- 🔐 **Cryptographic Practices**: Use proven algorithms (AES, RSA, SHA-256)

### ⚙️ Configuration Security

- 🔧 **System Configuration**: Maintain latest approved versions of all components
- 👤 **Default Account Management**: Disable/remove default credentials immediately
- 🌐 **Communication Security**: Encrypt all data in transit (TLS/SSL)

---

## 🚨 Common Vulnerabilities

### 💉 Injection Attacks

|Vulnerability|Countermeasure|Implementation|
|---|---|---|
|SQL Injection|Parameterized Queries|Use placeholders, not string concatenation|
|XSS|Output Encoding|Encode <, >, ", ', & characters|
|File Upload|Input Validation|Validate file type, size, content|

### 🔑 Authentication & Session Issues

- 🔒 **Weak Passwords**: Enforce complexity (8+ chars, upper, number, special)
- ⏰ **Session Management**: Proper timeouts and session handling
- ⬆️ **Privilege Escalation**: Restore proper privileges after exceptions

### 🔐 Cryptographic Failures

- 🧂 **Weak Hashing**: Use strong, salted hashing (bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt)
- ⚙️ **Default Configurations**: Change all default settings and credentials
- 🔑 **Key Management**: Proper encryption key storage and rotation

## ⚠️ Critical Exam Tips

### 🔍 Key Distinctions to Remember

- **BSIMM vs SAMM**: BSIMM studies what organizations do, SAMM prescribes what to do
- **Static vs Dynamic**: Static = no execution, Dynamic = while running
- **White vs Black box**: White = full internal access, Black = external perspective only
- **Every-sprint vs Bucket**: Every-sprint = always required, Bucket = when specific tech used
- **PASTA vs Microsoft**: PASTA has 7 stages, Microsoft has 4 steps (Diagram, Identify, Mitigate, Validate)
- **STRIDE applications**: Per-element (most granular), per-process (processes only), per-trust-boundary (boundaries), per-interaction (data flows)

### 🎯 Keyword Recognition

- "**Real-world initiatives**" → BSIMM
- "**Without executing**" → Static Analysis
- "**All traffic encrypted**" → Communication Security
- "**Default settings**" → Remove/disable default accounts
- "**Easily repeated**" → Reproducibility (DREAD)
- "**Design flaw analysis**" → PASTA Stage 5 (Vulnerability and Weakness Analysis)
- "**Data flow diagram**" → Microsoft Threat Modeling Step 1 (Diagram)
- "**Seven stages**" → PASTA methodology
- "**Four steps**" → Microsoft Threat Modeling

### 🚨 Common Traps

- Don't confuse **remediation** (how to fix) with **detection** (how to find)
- **Final Security Review** needs ALL issues resolved for "Passed" status
- **Bucket requirements** are triggered by technology, not always applied
- **PSIRT workflow**: Fix development comes before customer notification
