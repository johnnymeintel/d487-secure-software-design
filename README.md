# D487 Secure Software Design - Study Notes

**Status: ‚úÖ PASSED**

Complete study materials for WGU's D487 - Secure Software Design course covering Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) implementation.

## üìö What's Included

- **SDL Framework Overview** - Complete A1-A5 phase breakdown with deliverables
- **Key Success Factors** - Critical metrics for each SDL phase
- **Competency Mapping** - Course objectives aligned to SDL phases
- **Overlap Analysis** - High-risk confusion areas and terminology distinctions

## üéØ Quick Study Guide

### Core SDL Phases
- **A1**: Security Assessment (requirements & risk)
- **A2**: Architecture (threat modeling & design)
- **A3**: Design & Development (test planning)
- **A4**: Readiness (test execution & validation)
- **A5**: Ship (final review & release)
- **PRS**: Post-Release Support

### High-Risk Exam Areas
1. **Threat Modeling** - appears in multiple phases with different purposes
2. **Policy Compliance Analysis** - same deliverable name across A2-A5
3. **Security Testing** - planning vs execution vs validation distinctions
4. **Testing Types** - white-box vs black-box vs static vs dynamic
5. **Methodologies** - STRIDE vs PASTA vs DREAD vs BSIMM differences

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Start with SDL Framework** - understand phase flow and dependencies
2. **Study Deliverables** - memorize what each phase produces
3. **Practice Questions** - test knowledge of phase-specific concepts
4. **Review Overlap Analysis** - focus on high-confusion terminology

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Exam Tips

- Pay attention to **phase context** - same terms mean different things
- Watch for **verb indicators** - planning vs executing vs reviewing
- Note **scope qualifiers** - initial, updated, final
- Understand **role distinctions** - who does what in each phase

## üìñ Additional Resources

- NIST SP 800-53 (security controls)
- OWASP SAMM/BSIMM frameworks
- Microsoft SDL documentation
- Course textbook supplementary materials
